# Pool-Shark
3D pool simulation using OpenGL and SDL in C++

Named after https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh7HzJmZCyQ
but mostly unrelated as this has nothing to do with heroin addiction.

This is a 3D pool simulation set in a smokey jazz bar. 
It is written in C++ using OpenGL for the graphics and SDL for the windowing/input.

requires: SDL 2.0, GLEW
